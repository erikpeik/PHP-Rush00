# PHP-Rush00
After the first week of training in PHP, we had to do a small e-commerce website with its own data management system

### ðŸ”§ How to run: 
To run this website you are required to have MySQL server. We are storing our information there.
- We personally used [MAMP packaged by Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/stack/mamp).
  - While installing you dont need to have any other comonent then PhpMyAdmin.
- After setting up server you can git clone this repo to `/mamp/apache2/htdocs/`
- Open `install.php` on browser and fill you MySQL identifiers to form.
  - It will informate you if everything went fine. Otherways it just freezes.
- After that you have also touch `connect_db.php` and change there also your MySQL identifiers.
- Then webstore should be ready to go!
